Types of data structures

Abstract data types

1. Queue - Queues are FIFO data structures which means First in First Out
   the two functions any queue will have is enqueue (adding to the end of the queue) and dequeue (removing from the top of the queue)

2. Stacks - Stacks is an opposite of queue, and are LIFO data structures
   which means Last In First Out, you push something on top of a stack and pop something off the top of the stack.. With the stack everything is happening on top

3. List
4. Linked List
5. Trees - Binary search tree structure
6. Dictionaries - this is a key value pair structure
   Hashing is all about taking in some value and outputting a simpler version thereof
   Hash functions are fns that implements hashing algorithms
   while hash tables are applications of arrays and linked lists to try to leverage the best of both wolrds, trying to achieve constant time, worst case scenerio it becomes O(n)

7. Tries - Tries is truly constant time.. it is a fancier tree and it's short for retrieval.. A trie is a tree each of whose node is an array and it consumes of a lot of memory
